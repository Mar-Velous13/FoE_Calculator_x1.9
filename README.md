## Usage
1. Download files ("Code" > "Download Zip" > Unzip it)
2. Open "launch" folder and start "FoE_Calc.jar". For it to work both "foe_data.db" and
"lib" folder must be in the same directory as .jar file
3. Choose your Great Building (GB) from the list
4. Adjust string outcome below it
5. Generate string by clicking on the lvl you need in table
6. Paste the string in-game
	
## Bugs & Glitches
- Application might generate wrong string especially when choosing levels that are lower than current. Give it a few more tries and you should get the correct one
- Great Buildings from newer ages like SAT or SASH had limited data on them so that might be added to database later on

Developed in Apache NetBeans IDE 23 using java v17 originally. Downgraded to Java version 11 for easier access. For database was used local SQLite file to keep it simple
